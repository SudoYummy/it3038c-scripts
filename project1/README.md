# Project 1: Math with Speech Output

This program will ask the user for two numbers. Once the user enters two integers then it will add them together and read the output aloud.

Users are expected to enter integers. If they fail to do so, a try catch will provide an erro and they will have to reexecute the program

# Usage:

```
.\mathspeech.ps1

```
